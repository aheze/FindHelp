# What is the Cache? 

Find works by using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to search for text in photos. But because OCR is often time-consuming, Find has a feature called caching.

When you cache a photo, the OCR pre-searches it for text and saves a text file along with the image. This way, when you search in this photo later, search results will appear immediately (Whenever you edit the text in the search bar, results are updated). Photos that are cached will have this icon: 

To search in a photo that is not cached, you must press the `search` button on the keyboard. When you do this, Find searches for the word that you entered using OCR. 

However, you can press `search` to find using OCR on both cached photos and non-cached photos. You can make sure that you always get the most accurate results by doing this (Kind of a double-check).
