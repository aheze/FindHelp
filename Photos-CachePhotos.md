# How do I cache photos?

It's easy! You can even cache multiple photos at the same time.

**Caching an individual photo:**

1. Go to the **Photos gallery**, then tap a photo
2. The photo will zoom in, and you'll see this at the bottom of the screen:
![float]
3. Then, tap the ![indCache] button
4. Caching will begin! This will take a few seconds.

**Caching multiple photos:**

1. Go to the **Photos gallery**, then tap **Select**.
2. Select the photos that you want to cache
3. Tap the ![cache] button
4. Caching will begin! Depending on how many photos you selected, caching will take anywhere from 5 seconds to a few minutes. Sit back and maybe get a snack or something.
