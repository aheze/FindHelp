# What are Lists?
With Lists, you can save your searches for later. When you first install Find, 2 pre-made lists are at your disposal:
- Gluten-Free
- Word Problems

Anyways, a "List" is a list of words that Find searches for simultaneously. The words that a list contains are called [Matches](/Lists-WhatIsAMatch.md).

__Example:__ You make a list, called "Nature". It contains the following matches:

- Tree
- Rock
- Fish
- Stick

Now, when you use this list, Find searches for "Tree", "Rock", "Fish",  and "Stick" _at the same time_.

## Making your list
1. Start at the home screen of Find. 
2. Then, press the Menu button (The 3x3 dot grid), and then press the Lists button.
3. Press the ![addList] button.
4. The List Builder will appear! Add a name and description, then start adding Matches. Remember, matches are the words that Find will search for (when you use the list).

## Customizing your list
__Changing the icon__
1. Press `Icon`.
2. Select a icon that you think represents the list well.
&nbsp;

__Changing the color__

1. Press `Color`.
2. Select any color that you want. A color will help you organize you lists better, as well as find them faster.
3. As a side note, the color that you pick will also be the highlight color of found matches when you use the list.

## Using your list

In Find, you can search for text either:
- in the home screen
- in History

In both places, your lists appear above you keyboard. See below:
