# Find's Changelog
**Below you can see the history of Find!**

## 1.0 _April 5, 2020_

App submitted to App store!

## 1.0.1 (_April 9_ - 141 Metadata Rejected, _April 13_ - 158 resubmit)
**Note:** Apple messed the build up. The submitted build was 158, but the build appearing on the App Store was 141.

UI Updates:
- History photos have smarter corner radii
- Improved Dark Mode support
- Smoother transition when tapping a photo in History (on iPad)

Fixed these bugs:
- Photos don’t appear in History on first launch / Crash when tapped
- Go button partially covered during onboarding
- Stats menu disappears when a new match is found
- While finding from History, default highlight color reverts to blue after dismissing zoomed photo
- Crash on iPad when tapping certain buttons
- Placeholder image when camera access was denied

General Improvements:
- As long as one photo is not yet cached, tapping Cache when multiple photos are selected will now cache all selected photos
- Warnings are less obstructive

## 1.0.1 _April 18_ (377)

New Features:
- Share photos!
- Floating Keyboard support (iPad)

Fixed these bugs:
- Photos don’t appear in History on first launch
- Context Menu interaction enabled during selection mode in History
- Can’t dismiss onboarding
- During Caching, first and last photos are clipped

General Improvements:
- Minor improvements in Lists Builder
- Overlays are now also optimized for iPad


## 1.1.0 _July 2_ (377)

你好！We've translated Find into Chinese! However, only English and Pinyin are currently accepted as input for our text recognition engine.

More New Features:
- More focused onboarding and tutorials
- What's New screen for displaying new features

Fixed these bugs:
- "Ok" button covers up text in the tutorials
- Icon preview in the Lists Builder appears overly large
- Overlapping text in the Help screen

Name changes:
- "History" is now "Photos" (it got kind of confusing, so we renamed it)
- "Matches" is now "Words to Find" (we thought Matches was overly complex for such a simple function)
