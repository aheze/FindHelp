# How do I cache photos?

It's easy! You can even cache multiple photos at the same time.

**Caching multiple photos:**

1. Go to the History gallery, then press select
2. Select the photos that you want to cache
3. Hit the ![cache] button
4. Caching will begin! Depending on how many photos you selected, caching will take anywhere from 5 seconds to a few minutes. Sit back and maybe get a snack or something.

**Caching an individual photo:**

1. Go to the History gallery, then tap on a photo
2. The photo should zoom in and you should see this on the bottom:
![float]
3. Hit the ![cache] button
4. Caching will begin! This will take a few seconds.
