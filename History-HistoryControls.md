**Find:**  (![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjohnzheng/FindHelp/master/images/Screenshot%202020-03-30%20at%2010.52.47%20PM.png =50x50))
Tap to find in the selected photo, or photos. If the photo is cached, search results will appear immediately. If it is not cached, you must press the `search` button on the keyboard to view results (An Fast OCR search will be performed).

**Heart:**  (![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjohnzheng/FindHelp/master/images/Screenshot%202020-03-30%20at%2010.52.47%20PM.png =50x50))
Tap to Heart a photo, or Unheart if it is already hearted. Hearting doesn't do anything except put a pink tint (and a heart icon!) on the photo, making it easier for you to find it.

**Cache:**  (![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjohnzheng/FindHelp/master/images/Screenshot%202020-03-30%20at%2010.52.47%20PM.png =50x50))
Tap to cache the selected photo/photos. Caching will perform a Deep OCR search, which will take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two. Once a photo is cached, search results will appear immediately when you search in the photo. More on caching [here](/History-WhatIsTheCache.md).

**Delete:**  (![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjohnzheng/FindHelp/master/images/Screenshot%202020-03-30%20at%2010.52.47%20PM.png =50x50))
Tap delete will delete the photo and its cache, if it has one. This can't be undone.
