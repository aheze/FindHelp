# Find's Changelog
**Below you can see the history of Find _in Chinese_, starting from v1.1.0!**


## 1.1.0 _July 2_ (732)

我们把Find翻译成了中文！ 但是，目前仅支持英语和拼音作为我们OCR（Optical Character Recognition）引擎的输入。

更多新功能：
- More focused onboarding and tutorials
- What's New screen for displaying new features

Fixed these bugs:
- "Ok" button covers up text in the tutorials
- Icon preview in the Lists Builder appears overly large
- Overlapping text in the Help screen

Name changes:
- "History" is now "Photos" (it got kind of confusing, so we renamed it)
- "Matches" is now "Words to Find" (we thought Matches was overly complex for such a simple function)
